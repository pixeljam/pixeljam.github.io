Description  {#description}
------------
{% include images.md param="image2" %}

Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork is a collaboration between acclaimed comic book artist James Kochalka and indie game studio Pixeljam.
It's a unique hybrid of Galaga-style shoot 'em up, simple platforming action and Saturday morning cartoon. Help Glorkian Warrior defend his asteroid against an endless onslaught of alien invaders, and be prepared for somewhat unexpected results...

In early 2010, in an age before crowdfunding was a universally recognized concept, Pixeljam successfuly ran a Kickstarter campaign with James Kochalka to raise funds for an idea called Glorkian Warrior. After years of experiments, iterations and trials, we are proud to introduce the Glorkian universe to the world in compact, comedic endless shooter.




Features   {#features}
--------

{% include images.md param="image3" %}

* Art & story by James Kochalka, First Cartoonist Laureate for the state of Vermont!
* Game design, coding, and music by Pixeljam games, the same team that brought you DINO RUN
* Procedurally generated invader flight patterns and formations, with many different landscapes to explore
* Frenetic, "one more try" style gameplay
* Endearing characters and all-ages humor
* Based on James Kochalka's character in conjunction with his graphic novel series starting with â€œThe Glorkian Warrior Delivers a Pizza"


Can you reach the rank of Glorkian General or will you forever stay a Soft-Boned Space Cadet?




History   {#history}
--------

In early 2010, in an age before crowdfunding was a universally recognized concept, Pixeljam successfuly ran a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/james-kochalka-pixeljam-glorkian-warrior) campaign with James Kochalka to raise funds for an idea called Glorkian Warrior.  We were able to raise $11,200 with a goal of $10,000.

There were several game prototypes including a mini-game featuring Glork's pixellated sidekick, Glorkbot. Most of these made it only as far as the Pixeljam vault.

After all these experiments, iterations and trials, we presented the Glorkian Universe to the world in our compact, comedic endless shooter.




<!--Future Plans-->
<!---------------->

<!--Pixeljam is working with Noodlecake Games to release the Android version.-->

<!--We presently have no plans to bring Glorkian Warrior to any other platforms or consoles.-->

Quotes   {#quotes}
--------

{% include images.md param="image5" %}

> "The art, the humor â€“ the chorus of children that announce your weapons in an 80â€²s edutainment television tone â€“ itâ€™s got that perfect 'this is what I love about indie gaming' feel."

> > *-Jim Squires*, [Game Zebo](http://www.gamezebo.com/2014/03/13/glorkian-warrior-review/)


> "..if I had to sum up Glorkian Warrior in just one word it'd be this: delightful."

> > *-Jared Nelson*, [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2014/03/14/game-of-the-week-glorkian-warrior/)


> "Itâ€™s exactly what youâ€™d want a James Kochalka game to be: exuberant, naÃ¯ve, completely un-cynical, and â€” the bit I appreciate the most â€” a game that even as it dips so heavily into Galaga-ian inspiration still finds room to feel like something new..."

> > *-Brandon Boyer*, [Venus Patrol](http://venuspatrol.com/2014/03/venus-patrol-presents-glorkian-warrior-birthday-celebration/)


> "Itâ€™s a ridiculously charming game that makes me smile every time I play it. And Iâ€™m not a smiler, people."

> > *-Evan Killham*, [Cult of Mac]( http://www.cultofmac.com/270001/glorkian-warrior-trials-glork-review/)


> I have never heard my daughter laugh as loud or as long as she did when I read her James Kochalka new kids' graphic novel, The Glorkian Warrior Delivers a Pizza. My six year old literally howled with laughter as I read this to her at bedtime, and kicked her legs in the air, and thumped the pillow -- tears of laughter rolled down her cheeks.

> > *-Cory Doctorow*, [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2014/07/23/summer-reading-list-kids-book.html)
