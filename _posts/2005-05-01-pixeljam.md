Description {#description}
------------

Low resolution entertainment for high resolution people.



HISTORY   {#history}
-----------

Pixeljam was created in 2005 as a creative outlet for low resolution art and animation. Shortly after its founding members, Rich Grillotti and Miles Tilmann, decided to fulfill a lifelong dream and make games instead, carried by the momentum of the flourishing scene at the time.  After a lot of self-education and determination, the browser game "Gamma Bros" was born.

After being nominated in the 2007 Independent Game Festival for best web game, Miles and Rich decided to dive head first into game development and call it their full time job. The web classic Dino Run was released next, followed by a multitude of smaller games made for Adult Swim.

"Potatoman Seeks the Troof" followed next, and most recently "Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork", a collaboration with cartoonist James Kochalka.

##### What makes Pixeljam tick?

An insatiable desire to explore the outer limits of the low-resolution / pixelated style in games, art, and music.


Current   {#current}
-------------------

Pixeljam is working on releasing Glorkian Warrior in association with Noodlecake; Mac / PC versions of Glorkian Warrior: Trials of Glork  are now available.

Potatoman Seeks the Troof is being released on Steam December 3rd, 2014. It is under development for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch as well.

Dino Run is being developed for Steam.

In a world where the Troof is an unanswered question, Potatoman quests through the riddle. Through desert wastelands, thick forests, and dystopian cities, nothing is what it seems. With only his wits, his jump, and a question, Potatoman must potato forth through quirky and challenging platforming puzzles! Jump, run, and engage in humorous potatosophical debate as your avatar dies a thousand deaths... encounter spud-shredding baddies and quick platformer pacing in this new Pixeljam release. Don't end up a potato pancake... go forward and seek the Troof!

A Giant asteroid has crash landed and extinction may just be inevitable. You are a Velociraptor -- and you should probably start running for your life! Run, jump, catch a ride with a Pterodactyl, eat power-up plants & other things, save all the dino eggs you can!

Jump into the multiplayer and test your speed against your fellow dinos as you race for glory -- and to avoid extinction!
