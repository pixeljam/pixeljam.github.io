{% include images.md param="image5" %}


> Potatoman will delight, surprise, and challenge you. I had so much fun playing through his little adventure, and I know I'll replay it many times in the future. And the ending is amazing! Definitely play all the way to the end.

> > *-James Kochalka*, [American Elf](http://americanelf.com/)


>Potatoman is an awesome bite-sized platformer that is as fun as it is, well, insane.

> > *-Northernlion*, [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion)


>Good, addictive fun, with a nice balance between level-memorization and hand-eye coordination.

> > *-Cory Doctorow*, [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/07/potatoman-seeks-the-troof-fun.html)


>...the conclusion is beautiful in its use of game mechanics to make the player feel a loss of ability. By making old obstacles suddenly seem impossible, it shows the player what it feels like to surrender oneself to encroaching inevitability, to just give up and embrace whatâ€™s coming.

> > *-Travis Pynenburg*, Pure Sophistry


>Potatoman has the Best jump in the history of video games, seriously.

> > *-PewDiePie*, [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g28hg7TQSsU)
